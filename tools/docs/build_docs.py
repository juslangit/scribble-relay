"""Builds docs/index.html: the whole record of Scribble Relay in one file.

Luqman asked on 2026-09-15 for every game except Referee For Fun (which already had one) to
get the same kind of record Referee For Fun has: one HTML file holding the idea, the planning,
every decision and method, the session logs, and the screenshots with their explanations,
kept in the repo and rebuilt whenever the game changes. So this is a generator rather than a
hand-written page: the project notes stay the source of truth, and the page is rebuilt from them.
Scribble Relay's screenshots all come from ./test/run.sh, so run that first when the game changes.

    python3 tools/docs/build_docs.py
    python3 tools/docs/build_docs.py --publish                # and rebuild the local records site

The page is published as a website at SITE below. `docs-site publish` collects every
project's docs/index.html and deploys them together, so the link never changes and
anyone can open it.

Reads:
    ~/.claude/knowledge/projects/scribble-relay/*.md and log/*.md   (override: KNOWLEDGE=...)
    the screenshots named in GALLERIES
    the header comments of the files named in CATALOGUES
    git log

Writes docs/index.html, fully self-contained: every screenshot is embedded as a JPEG. No
Python packages beyond the standard library; `sips` (built into macOS) shrinks the images.

To add something: add its screenshots to a gallery in GALLERIES and run this again. Notes
written into the knowledge base appear on their own. Everything above the "engine" line is
this game's; everything below it is the same in every game's copy.
